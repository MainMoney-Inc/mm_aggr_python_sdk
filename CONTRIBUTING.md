## Pull requests

- Include tests for behavior changes.
- Do not invent merchant API endpoints. Implement from the pinned OpenAPI in
  the contrib hub (`contract/openapi/merchants.openapi.yaml`, checkout path
  `contrib/contract/` from `mm_aggregator`). Cross-check live
  `/api/v1/schema/merchants/` if the pin may be behind.
- Do not commit secrets.
